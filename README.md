![Trousseau, a portable encrypted keyring](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2497327/Github/trousseau/trousseau-animation.gif)

## What

*Trousseau* is a **gpg** encrypted key-value store designed to be a *simple*, *safe* and *trustworthy* place for your data.
It stores data in a single multi-recipients encrypted file and can supports both local and remote storage sources (S3 and ssh so far) import/export.

Create a *trousseau* store, specify which *gpg* recipients are allowed to open and modify it, add some key-value pairs to it, export it to S3 for example, and re-import it on another device. As simple as that.

Whether you're a devops, a paranoid guy living in a bunker, or the random user who seeks a simple way to store it's critical data in secured manner. *Trousseau* can do something for you.

<div class="section-break"></div>
## Why

Storing, transporting, and sharing sensitive data can be hard, and much more difficult when it comes to automate it.

*Trousseau* was created with private keys transportation and sharing across a servers cluster in mind.
However it has proved being useful to anyone who need to store and eventually share a passwords store, bank accounts details or even more sensitive data.

<div class="subsection-break"></div>
### Real world use cases

<div class="subsection-break"></div>
#### For the devops out there

*Trousseau can be useful to you when it comes to*:

* **Store** sensitive data: Your brand new shiny infrastructure surely relies on many certificates and private keys of different kinds: ssl, rsa, gpg, ... *Trousseau* provides a simple and fine-tuned way to store their content in a single file that you can safely version using your favorite cvs. No more plain certificates and keys in your repositories and configuration files.
* **Share** passwords, keys and other critical data with co-workers and servers in your cluster in a safe manner. *Trousseau* encrypts its content for the specific recipient you provide it. Only the recipient you intend will be able to import and read-write the *Trousseau* store content. *Trousseau* proved itself to be a great way to share some services passwords with your co-workers too!
* **Deploy** keys to your servers in a safe and normative way. Encrypt the trousseau store for each server selectively.

<div class="subsection-break"></div>
#### For the common users

* **Store** your sensitive data like passwords, bank account details, sex tapes involving you and your teachers or whatever comes to your mind in an encrypted store.
* **Sync** your sensitive data store to remote services and easily share it between your unix-like devices.

## It's open-source

*Trousseau* is open source software under the MIT license.
Any hackers are welcome to supply ideas, features requests, patches, pull requests and so on.
Let's make *Trousseau* awesome!

## Installation

<div class="subsection-break"></div>
### Debian and ubuntu

A binary debian repository provides *trousseau* packages for *i386*, *x86_64* and *arm* architectures, so you can easily install it.
Just add the repository to your sources.list:

```bash
$ echo "deb http://dl.bintray.com/oleiade/deb /" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/trousseau.list
```

And you're ready to go:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install trousseau
```

<div class="subsection-break"></div>
### OSX

#### Homebrew

If you're using homebrew just proceed to installation using the provided formula:

```bash
$ brew install trousseau.rb
```

*Et voila!*

#### Macports

Coming soon (Don't be shy, if you feel like you could do it, just send pull request ;) )

<div class="subsection-break"></div>
### Build it

1. First, make sure you have a `Go <http://http://golang.org/>` language compiler **>= 1.1.2** (*mandatory*) and `git <http://gitscm.org>` installed.
2. Make sure you have the following go system dependencies in your `$PATH`: `bzr, svn, hg, git`
3. Then `make` to build and `make install` to install

```bash
make
sudo make install
```

<div class="section-break"></div>
## Prerequisities

<div class="subsection-break"></div>
### Gpg passphrase

Every decryption operations will require your *gpg* primary key passphrase.
As of today, **trousseau** is able to handle your passphrase through multiple ways:
* system's keyring manager
* gpg-agent daemon
* system environment
* ``--passphrase`` global option

##### Keyring manager

Supported system keyring manager are osx keychain access and linux gnome secret-service and gnome-keychain (more might be added in the future on demand).
To use the keyring manager you will need to set up the ``TROUSSEAU_KEYRING_SERVICE`` environment variable to the name of they keyring manager key holding the trousseau main gpg key passphrase.

```bash
$ export TROUSSEAU_KEYRING_SERVICE=my_keyring_key
$ trousseau get abc
```

##### Gpg agent

Another authentication method supported is gpg-agent. In order to use it make sure you've started the gpg-agent daemon and exported the ``GPG_AGENT_INFO`` variable, trousseau will do the rest.

```bash
$ export GPG_AGENT_INFO=path_to_the_gpg_agent_info_file
$ export TROUSSEAU_MASTER_GPG_ID=myid@mymail.com
$ trousseau get abc
```

##### Environment variable

Alternatively, you can pass your primary key passphrase as `TROUSSEAU_PASSPHRASE` environment variable:

```bash
$ export TROUSSEAU_PASSPHRASE=mysupperdupperpassphrase
$ trousseau get abc
```

##### Passphrase global option

Ultimately, you can pass you gpg passphrase through the command line global option:

```bash
$ trousseau --passhphrase mysupperdupperpassphrase get abc
```

<div class="section-break"></div>
## Let's get started

<div class="subsection-break"></div>
### Basics

First use of **trousseau** requires the data store to be created. A **trousseau** data store is built and maintained for a list of *gpg* recipients who will be the only ones able to decrypt and manipulate it (so don't forget to include yourself ;) )

<div class="break"></div>
#### API

* **create** [RECIPIENTS ...] : creates the trousseau encrypted datastore for provided recipients and stores it in `$HOME/.trousseau`
* **meta** : Outputs the store metadata.
* **add-recipient** RECIPIENT : Adds a recipient to the store. The recipient will be able to open and modify the store.
* **remove-recipient** RECIPIENT : Removes a recipient from the store. The recipient will not be able to open or modify the store.

<div class="break"></div>
#### First steps with the data store

```bash
$ trousseau create 4B7D890,28EA78B  # create a trousseau for two gpg recipients
trousseau created at $HOME/.trousseau
```

Trousseau data store consists in single gpg encrypted file residing in your ``$HOME`` directory. Check by yourself.

```bash
$ cat ~/.trousseau

<div class="break"></div>
### Manipulating keys

Once your trousseau has been created, you're now able to read, write, list, delete its data. Here's how the fun part goes.

<div class="break"></div>
#### API

* **get** KEY : Outputs the stored KEY-value pair
* **set** KEY VALUE : Sets the provided key-value pair in store
* **del** KEY : Deletes provided key from the store
* **keys** : Lists the stored keys
* **show** : Lists the stored key-value pairs

<div class="break"></div>
#### You've got the keys

```bash
# Right now the store is empty
$ trousseau show


# Let's add some data into it
$ trousseau set abc 123
$ trousseau set "easy as" "do re mi"
$ trousseau set oleiade-private-key "`cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa`"


# Now let's make sure data has been added
$ trousseau keys
abc
easy as
oleiade-private-key

$ trousseau get abc
123

$ trousseau show
abc: 123
easy as: do re mi
oleiade-private-key: --- BEGIN PRIVATE KEY ---
...


# Now if you don't need a key anymore, just drop it.
$ trousseau del abc  # Now the song lacks something doesn't it?
```

<div class="break"></div>
### Importing/Exporting to remote storage

Trousseau was built with data remote storage in mind. Therefore it provides *push* and *pull* actions to export and import the trousseau data store to remote destinations.
As of today S3 and SSH storages are available (more are to come).
Moreover, 

<div class="break"></div>
#### API

* **push** : Pushes the trousseau data store to remote storage
* **pull** : Pulls the trousseau data store from remote storage

<div class="break"></div>
#### DSN

In order to make your life easier trousseau allows you to select your export and import sources using a *DSN*.

```
    {protocol}://{identifier}:{secret}@{host}:{port}/{path}
```

* **protocol**: The remote service target type. Can be one of: *s3* or *scp*
* **identifier**: The login/key/whatever to authenticate **trousseau** to the remote service. Provide your *aws_access_key* if you're targeting *s3*, or your remote login if you're targeting *scp*.
* **secret**: The secret to authenticate **trousseau** to the remote service. Provide your *aws_secret_key* if you're targeting *s3*, or your remote password if you're targeting *scp*.
* **host**: Your bucket name is you're targeting *s3*. The host to login to using *scp* otherwise.
* **port**: The *aws_region* if you're targeting *s3*. The port to login to using *scp* otherwise.
* **path**: The remote path to push to or retrieve from the trousseau file on a ``push`` or ``pull`` action.

<div class="break"></div>
#### S3 Example

```bash
# Considering a non empty trousseau data store
$ trousseau show
abc: 123
easy as: do re mi

# And then you're ready to push
$ trousseau push s3://aws_access_key:aws_secret_key@bucket:region/remote_file_path


# Now that data store is pushed to S3, let's remove the
# local data store and pull it once again to ensure it worked
$ rm ~/.trousseau
$ trousseau show
Trousseau unconfigured: no data store

$ trousseau pull s3://aws_access_key:aws_secret_key@bucket:region/remote_file_path
$ trousseau show
abc: 123
easy as: do re mi
```

<div class="break"></div>
#### Scp example

```bash
# We start with a non-empty trousseau data store
$ trousseau show
abc: 123
easy as: do re mi

# To push it using scp we need to provide it a couple of
# basic options
$ trousseau push scp://user:password@host:port/remote_file_path


# Now that data store has been pushed to the remote storage
# using scp, let's remove the local data store and pull it
# once again to ensure it worked
$ rm ~/.trousseau
$ trousseau show
Trousseau unconfigured: no data store

$ trousseau pull scp://user:password@host:port/remote_file_path
$ trousseau show
abc: 123
easy as: do re mi
```

<div class="subsection-break"></div>
### Local imports and exports

#### API

* **import** FILENAME: will import a trousseau data store from the local filesystem. The operation **erases** the current trousseau store content.
* **export** FILENAME: will export the current trousseau data store as `FILENAME` on the local fs.

#### Real world example

```bash
$ trousseau export testtrousseau.asc  # Fine we've exported our current data store into a single file
$ mail -f testtrousseau.asc cousin@machin.com  # Let's pretend we've sent it by mail

# Now cousin machin is now able to import the data store
$ trousseau import testtrousseau.asc
$ trousseau show
cousin_machin:isagreatbuddy
adams_family:rests in peace, for sure
```

<div class="break"></div>
### Metadata

Trousseau keeps track and exposes all sort of metadata about your store that you can access through the ``meta`` command.

```bash
$ trousseau meta
CreatedAt: 2013-08-12 08:00:20.457477714 +0200 CEST
LastModifiedAt: 2013-08-12 08:00:20.457586991 +0200 CEST
Recipients: [4B7D890,28EA78B]
TrousseauVersion: 0.1.0c
```

Once again, if you're intersted in how the meta data are stored, go check yourself by decrypting the store content using one of your recipients private key.

```bash
$ cat ~/.trousseau | gpg -d -r 4B7D890 --textmode
You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for
user: "My Gpg User <MyGpg@mail.com>"
2048-bit RSA key, ID 4B7D890, created 2013-05-21 (main key ID 4B7D890)

gpg: encrypted with 2048-bit RSA key, ID 4B7D890, created 2013-05-21
  "My Gpg User <MyGpg@mail.com>"
{"_meta":{"created_at":"2013-08-12 08:00:20.457477714 +0200 CEST","last_modified_at":"2013-08-12 08:00:20.457586991 +0200 CEST","recipients":["92EDE36B"],"version":"0.1.0"},"data":{}}
```

<div class="break"></div>
### Adding and removing recipients

Okay, so you've created a trousseau data store with two recipients allowed to manipulate it. Now suppose you'd like to add another recipient to be able to open and update the trousseau store; or to remove one.
``add-recipient`` and ``remove-recipient`` commands can help you with that.

```bash
$ trousseau add-recipient 75FE3AB
$ trousseau add-recipient 869FA4A
$ trousseau meta
CreatedAt: 2013-08-12 08:00:20.457477714 +0200 CEST
LastModifiedAt: 2013-08-12 08:00:20.457586991 +0200 CEST
Recipients: [4B7D890, 75FE3AB, 869FA4A]
TrousseauVersion: 0.1.0c

$ trousseau remove-recipient 75FE3AB
$ trousseau meta
CreatedAt: 2013-08-12 08:00:20.457477714 +0200 CEST
LastModifiedAt: 2013-08-12 08:00:20.457586991 +0200 CEST
Recipients: [4B7D890, 869FA4A]
TrousseauVersion: 0.1.0c
```
